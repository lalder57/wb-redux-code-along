## Redux Favorite Color setter

This project is an extremely basic example of using redux to set a favorite color on a landing page and then view that favorite color in the home page.

There are two methods of setting up Redux shown in the repo. To view these different methods you will need to switch branches. There are quite a few branches in this repo as I use it with different cohorts on a regular basis, but there are only three that you'll want to reference if you're reviewing the repo yourself: 

### main
This is the template of the two pages without redux. 

### basic-redux 
This is the completed project using a basic reducer and store

### slice
This branch uses the newer redux syntax of slices, and adds a favorite meal to global state in addition to the favorite color. 


## How to use
- Fork the repo to your own GitHub account
- Clone the repo
- Navigate between branches with the `git checkout` command. To see what branch you are on run `git branch` and your current branch should be highlited. If you are on the `main` branch and want to see the example of a basic reducer, run `git checkout basic-reducer` and you will be switched to that branch. Likewise to see the example of slices you would run `git checkout slices`.
